description: This study uses Hierarchical Linear Models to estimate disability trajectories for Mexican Americans. We were particularly interested in finding out if the speed of disability growth for immigrants was different based on the strictness of the U.S. immigration law and policy when they arrived. The image above shows that more restrictive migration regimes are associated with larger numbers of disabilities. I analyzed the data and summarized the findings and my colleague Collin Meuller placed in in the academic literature. The paper for this project is currently under review (revise and resubmit).
