category: Data Science; Health; Law
description: This study uses Hierarchical Linear Models to estimate disability trajectories for Mexican Americans.

The image above shows that more restrictive migration regimes are associated with larger numbers of disabilities. I analyzed the data and summarized the findings and my colleague Collin Meuller placed in in the academic literature. [Download the graphic](img/portfolio/paradox.png)
