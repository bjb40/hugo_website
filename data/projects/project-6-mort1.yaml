category: Data Science; Health; Law
description: In 1999, the United States changed the way it assigned causes of death to individuals. This study analyzes the impact of that change. Using data from 23 million individual death certificates reported to the Centers for Disease Control, this study uses a series of Bayesian Hierarchical Models to sample posterior predictive data to identify the impact of the change. The poster above shows that the change erased a decline in the proportion of acute conditions (like pneumonia) relative to chronic conditions (like heart attacks). This means some of the apparent "progress" against mortality from acute disease is really just a coding change. Accordingly, it is important to account for procedural changes when using cause of death statistics to measure population health.
